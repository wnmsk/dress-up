# 🕴️Dress-Up

Dress-Up provides a parser-only implementation of the [SUIT][suit-rfc] manifest format,
for `no_std` environments. It relies on [minicbor] for CBOR parsing.
Dress-Up parses CBOR on the fly during manifest execution and is zero-copy.

Dress-Up is OS-agnostic, it provides a `OperatingHooks` trait
that allow an operating system to provide integration into the manifest processing.
While Dress-Up is developed under the Ariel OS banner, it is not tied to Ariel OS.

🚧 This crate is still under heavy construction 🚧

The full manifest must be in memory during parsing.
The authentication object covers the inner manifest.
Both must be in for authentication. The other reason is that Dress-Up is zero-copy.
All text and byte strings are references into the CBOR data.

Dress-up only supports sequential processing of components.
Each component described in a manifest processes serially.
This saves the amount of memory required during the manifest
processing.

## Supported RFC features

Dress-Up supports the following features from the SUIT manifest specification:

- Multiple components

Dress-Up does not yet support the following features:

- Severable elements
- Reporting policy

Dress-Up will never support the following features. These are out of scope:

- Parallel processing
- Manifest creation

## Overview

This section gives a brief overview of the primary types in this crate.

- [`SuitManifest`]: This starts the SUIT manifest parsing. Contains the functions required to
  check manifest validity. The [`Envelope`] structure derives from this.
- [`Envelope`]: Describes the SUIT Envelope structure. The Envelope contains both the
  authentication object and the manifest itself.
- [`manifest::Manifest`]: Contains the inner SUIT manifest. It provides access to the command
  sequences in the manifest.
- [`OperatingHooks`]: This trait provides the interface to the operating system functions
  required by Dress-Up. The operating system or application running Dress-Up must provide an
  implementation.

## Workflow

A typical flow with Dress-Up consists of multiple steps:

1. Start the parsing by creating a [`SuitManifest`].
2. Authenticate the manifest via [`SuitManifest::authenticate`].
3. Derive the [`Envelope`] from the [`SuitManifest`] via [`SuitManifest::envelope`].
4. Deriver the inner [`Manifest`] from the [`Envelope`] via [`Envelope::manifest`].
5. check the existence of different command sequences and execute them when available.

## Example

```
use cbor_edn::StandaloneItem;
use dress_up::SuitManifest;
# use minicbor::bytes::ByteSlice;
# use dress_up::error::Error;
# fn authenticate(_cose: &[u8], _auth: &[u8]) -> Result<bool, Error> {
#    Ok(true)
# }
